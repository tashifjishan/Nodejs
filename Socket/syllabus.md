# What are streams?
Streams in Node.js are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion â€” like handling data chunk-by-chunk instead of loading everything into memory at once.

## ðŸ“˜ Types of Streams
- Readable â€“ For reading data (e.g., fs.createReadStream)
- Writable â€“ For writing data (e.g., fs.createWriteStream)
- Duplex â€“ Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets)
- Transform â€“ A duplex stream that modifies data as it's written/read (e.g., zlib.createGzip)

## âœ… Why Use Streams?
- Efficient memory usage (especially with large files)
- Handles backpressure automatically
- Built-in in Node.js core modules

## ðŸ“Œ Common Events:
- 'data' â€“ Emitted when a chunk is available
- 'end' â€“ No more data to read
- 'error' â€“ Error occurred
- 'finish' â€“ All data written
